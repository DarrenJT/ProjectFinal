# ProjectFinal

## Note: This repository was created due to a communication issue with the previous repo that affected the functionality of the application.

First project as part of training. 

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This is the first project assigned as part of the QA training for the AMS tech skilling programme.

The project involves concepts from the core training modules that have been covered thus far. 

The specific areas being covered are as follows

* Project Management 
* Python Fundamentals
* Python Testing 
* Git 
* Basic Linux
* Python Web Development 
* Continuous Integration
* Cloud Fundamentals
* Databases

## PROJECT OBJECTIVE 

The goal of this project is to create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools,
methodologies and technologies that were introduced during the core training.

## PROJECT VISION

For my project I decided to create an Employee Management system. The way I envisioned this project was that it would be used by a Human Resources Department within a business, and it was serve as a means to record employee information during the onboarding process. It could also be updated throughout the employee lifecycle as information changes and removed during dismmissals or resignations. 


## SCHEMA DESIGN

The outline for the layout of the database linked to the application and where the data would be stored can be seen in the diagram below.

### DOCUMENTATION/PROJECT TRACKING
A trello board was created to facilitate the project tracking requirements of the development process. Task were divided into ToDo, Doing and Done segments, with an additional segment for Design Requirements containing the necessary story points.

## RISK ASSESSMENT    

As part of the development process, a risk assessment was conducted to identify possible risks that could present themselves during the building and deploying of the app. This assessment identifies the risks, determines their threat level, and discusses preventative measures and responses to them.

## THE APP

When the app is first entered the user is presented with the home page.

From there, they have several options regarding the data that is currently and can be displayed on screen. 
By selecting the 'Add New Employees' option on the top right of the screen, a pop up menu is generated that enables the user to enter in requested fields that will create a new entry into the employee data base.

After entering information into the requested fields, the user can then click 'submit', which will populate the home page with their given data. 

Similar functionalty can be seen with the 'Edit' option, where once clicked, a pop up menu with the information already entered into the field will present itself, in which the user can then alter the information and resubmit the field.

When the 'Delete' option next to the field is selected, a confirmation message will appear on the top of the screen requesting that the user confirm whether they wish to proceed with the removal of an entry in the application. Should the user select 'Ok', the given field will be deleted.

# FUTURE WORK

Within the development time given, I was able to create the page in which employee information was able to be added, updated and deleted. In future development I plan to add the 'Department' field, as well as include a separate page that lists the employees registered under their assigned departments.
