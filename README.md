First project as part of training. 

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This is the first project assigned as part of the QA training for the AMS tech skilling programme.

The project involves concepts from the core training modules that have been covered thus far. 

The specific areas being covered are as follows

* Project Management 
* Python Fundamentals
* Python Testing 
* Git 
* Basic Linux
* Python Web Development 
* Continuous Integration
* Cloud Fundamentals
* Databases

## PROJECT OBJECTIVE 

The goal of this project is to create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools,
methodologies and technologies that were introduced during the core training.

## PROJECT VISION

For my project I decided to create an Employee Management system. The way I envisioned this project was that it would be used by a Human Resources Department within a business, and it was serve as a means to record employee information during the onboarding process. It could also be updated throughout the employee lifecycle as information changes and removed during dismmissals or resignations. 

## SCHEMA DESIGN

The outline for the layout of the database linked to the application and where the data would be stored can be seen in the diagram below.

### DOCUMENTATION/PROJECT TRACKING
A trello board was created to facilitate the project tracking requirements of the development process. Task were divided into ToDo, Doing and Done segments, with an additional segment for Design Requirements containing the necessary story points.
